# Dynamic Navigation and Uncertainty-Aware Replanning in Unknown Environments

This repository implements a full research-oriented pipeline for **autonomous robotic navigation in unknown environments under sensing and localization uncertainty**.  
The system integrates:

- **ROS 2** navigation stack  
- **Visual Odometry (VO)** and SLAM-style mapping  
- **Uncertainty-aware coverage planning & exploration**  
- **Learned A\*** heuristics with online adaptation  
- **Belief–risk planning, self-trust and OOD-aware behavior**  
- **Multi-objective planners** for safety, coverage and efficiency  

with **extensive quantitative evaluation, ablation studies and statistical validation**.

The work was developed as an **individual research project** at the  
School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Democritus University of Thrace (D.U.Th.).

## 1. Research Problem

Autonomous navigation in realistic, unknown environments is fundamentally constrained by:

- **Sensor uncertainty**, especially visual odometry drift and feature sparsity  
- **Incomplete, evolving maps** during exploration  
- **Dynamic obstacles and online replanning** requirements  
- **Trade-offs** between path optimality, coverage, safety and computation time  

Classical global planners (e.g. A\*, RRT\*) typically assume:

- reliable state estimation  
- static cost maps  
- and no explicit notion of risk/uncertainty in the objective.

In practice, **pose drift, tracking failures and miscalibrated uncertainty estimates** directly affect navigation quality and safety.  
This project studies **how navigation performance can be improved by explicitly modeling uncertainty**, learning data-driven heuristics, and adding **self-trust and out-of-distribution (OOD)-aware behavior** to the planning loop.

## 2. Main Contributions

### 2.1 Core Navigation & Coverage

- **Uncertainty-aware coverage planning** using VO-derived feature density and pose uncertainty.  
- **Dynamic navigation and replanning** based on an uncertainty-weighted priority field.  
- **Information Gain (IG) & Next-Best-View (NBV) exploration** in partially known maps.  
- **Multi-objective navigation** combining entropy reduction, coverage, path length and safety.

### 2.2 Learned Heuristics for A\*

- **Neural learned heuristic for A\*** that preserves optimality while reducing node expansions.  
  - Up to **~70% reduction in expansions** (e.g. *1099 → 324* expansions)  
    with **no degradation** in the optimal path cost.  
- **Online self-improving loop**:
  - the heuristic is refined iteratively as more planning data is collected,  
  - leading to **steady improvements** across successive iterations.

### 2.3 Uncertainty-Aware Exploration and Replanning

- **VO-based coverage replanning**:
  - coverage improves from **~25.49% → 100%** with uncertainty-aware missing-cell replanning.  
- **Uncertainty-aware exploration**:
  - IG-based NBV selection augmented with **VO-derived uncertainty**  
  - avoids over-exploring regions with unreliable pose estimates.  
- **Multi-objective planner**:
  - combines **entropy**, **uncertainty** and **path cost**,  
  - achieving **mean planning time ~0.8 ms per query**.

### 2.4 Drift Prediction, Calibration and Safe Behavior

- **Drift-aware exploration**:
  - VO drift is predicted via a learned model (e.g. ridge regression / neural net),  
  - drift is **penalized directly in the exploration objective**,  
  - discouraging trajectories through regions with high expected drift.  
- **UKF fusion of VO & wheel odometry**:
  - reduces mean drift (e.g. **mean ≈ 0.045** in normalized units),  
  - provides **pose uncertainty estimates** that are propagated into the planning grid.  
- **Uncertainty calibration**:
  - learns and calibrates predictive uncertainty grids,  
  - enabling **risk-sensitive planning** that is robust to over/under-confident models.

## 5. Quantitative Results

  while preserving **optimal path cost**.  
- **Online self-improving loop**:
  - as new trajectories are added to the dataset,
  - the heuristic improves over successive training iterations.

### 5.2 Coverage & Exploration Performance

- **VO-based coverage replanning**:
  - initial coverage ~**25.49%**  
  - improved to **100%** after uncertainty-aware replanning.  
- **Uncertainty-aware exploration**:
  - avoids low-texture / high-drift regions  
  - maintains coverage while limiting exposure to unreliable pose estimates.

### 5.3 Risk-Sensitive Planning, Self-Trust and OOD-Aware Behavior

We designed a synthetic benchmark with **multiple navigation scenarios**.  
Each trial contains three candidate paths with different:

- geometric path length  
- drift exposure  
- integrated uncertainty  

We compare four policies:

1. **baseline_shortest**  
   - Ignores risk entirely; always chooses the shortest path.  
   - Mean path length: **≈ 10.18**  
   - Mean drift exposure: **≈ 2.58**  
   - Success rate: **~70%**

2. **fixed_risk**  
   - Uses a fixed weight λ on drift/uncertainty.  
   - Mean path length: **≈ 10.8**  
   - Mean drift ≈ **1.6**  
   - Success rate: **> 90%**

3. **adaptive_risk**  
   - Dynamically adapts λ based on a **self-trust index S**  
   - Similar path length to fixed_risk (**≈ 10.8**)  
   - Mean drift ≈ **1.6**  
   - Success rate: **> 90%**

4. **ood_aware**  
   - Activates a **safe mode** in “difficult” environments,  
   - chooses paths with **minimum drift/uncertainty**.  
   - Mean path length: **≈ 11.16**  
   - Mean drift: **≈ 1.47**  
   - Success rate: **~94%**  
   - Safe mode triggered in **~31.5%** of trials.

**Conclusion:**  
Explicit modeling of uncertainty, self-trust and OOD-awareness yields **substantially safer navigation** (lower drift, higher success rate) at **minimal cost in path length**.

### 5.4 Uncertainty Calibration & Drift Modeling

- **Uncertainty calibration**:
  - learned vs calibrated uncertainty grids are compared on fixed paths  
  - calibration reshapes risk distribution, correcting over/under-confidence while preserving trajectory structure.  
- **Drift-aware NBV**:
  - comparison of classical vs drift-aware NBV:
    - drift-aware policy systematically reduces exposure to high-drift regions  
    - maintains comparable information gain over multi-step exploration.

- `analyze_learned_vs_calib_paths.py`, `plot_learned_vs_calib_paths.py`  
- `drift_aware_nbv_experiment.py`, `drift_aware_nbv_multistep.py`

# Simulation Results: Self-Healing + Language-Driven Safety

This module currently runs as a **software-level simulation**, not directly on a physical robot.  
The behavior is still *scientifically meaningful*: it demonstrates how self-healing autonomy and language-driven
safety can modulate a navigation planner when integrated into a real robotic system.

---

## What Is Being Simulated?

At each step, the system receives:

### 1. Robot Reliability Metrics (simulated)

- `drift`
- `calibration_error`
- `heuristic_regret`
- `failure_rate`

### 2. A Human Language Message

- English or Greek natural-language descriptions of the environment.

---

## System Behavior

For every input pair *(metrics + language message)*, the system:

1. Evaluates the **Self-Healing Navigation Policy**  
2. Evaluates the **Language-Driven Safety Policy**  
3. Updates an `AbstractPlanner` with new parameters:

- maximum linear velocity
- maximum angular velocity
- obstacle inflation radius
- goal tolerance
- risk weight λ (`lambda_risk`)
- safe mode on/off

The planner in this demo is an **abstract, software-only planner** (no real robot actuation yet), but its
parameters are exactly the kind a real navigation stack would use (e.g., Nav2 or `move_base`).

## Example Output (from the Integrated Demo)

Below are representative outputs from the integrated self-healing + language-safety demo.

---

### Step 1 – Neutral, Low-Risk Scenario

```text
===== STEP 1 =====
Message: Balanced corridor, nothing special here.

Self-Healing Decision: {
  'SELF_HEALING_TRIGGER': False,
  'reasons': [],
  'recommended_actions': [],
  'new_lambda': 0.75,
  'safe_mode': False
}

Language Safety: {
  'risk_scale': 1.0,
  'uncertainty_scale': 1.0,
  'factors': [],
  'explanation': 'No language-driven adjustment (neutral message).'
}

Planner Parameters: {
  'max_linear_velocity': 0.6,
  'max_angular_velocity': 1.0,
  'obstacle_inflation_radius': 0.4,
  'goal_tolerance': 0.15,
  'lambda_risk': 0.75
}
```

**Interpretation**

- The message describes a “balanced corridor, nothing special” → no language-induced risk.
- The robot metrics are healthy → no self-healing trigger.
- The planner remains in a **nominal configuration**.

### Step 2 – Crowded Area with Children

```text
===== STEP 2 =====
Message: There are many people and children ahead.

Self-Healing Decision: {
  'SELF_HEALING_TRIGGER': False,
  'reasons': [],
  'recommended_actions': [],
  'new_lambda': 0.5,
  'safe_mode': False
}

Language Safety: {
  'risk_scale': 2.4,
  'uncertainty_scale': 1.21,
  'factors': ['crowding / many people', 'children present'],
  'explanation': 'Language-driven factors:\n  - crowding / many people\n  - children present'
}

Planner Parameters: {
  'max_linear_velocity': 0.25,
  'max_angular_velocity': 0.42,
  'obstacle_inflation_radius': 0.96,
  'goal_tolerance': 0.18,
  'lambda_risk': 0.5
}
```

**Interpretation**

The language mentions *crowding* and *children*:

- The system increases `risk_scale` and `uncertainty_scale`.
- The planner responds by:
  - reducing maximum speed (more cautious motion),
  - inflating obstacles more (larger safety buffer),
  - slightly increasing goal tolerance.

This is a realistic, human-centered adjustment: the robot behaves more conservatively when informed about
vulnerable humans and crowded spaces.

### Step 3 – Hidden Hazard with Increased Drift

```text
===== STEP 3 =====
Message: Be careful, hidden danger around the corner.

Self-Healing Decision: {
  'SELF_HEALING_TRIGGER': True,
  'reasons': ['drift 0.70 ≥ threshold 0.60'],
  'recommended_actions': ['adjust_state_estimator', 'increase_risk_weight'],
  'new_lambda': 0.75,
  'safe_mode': False
}

Language Safety: {
  'risk_scale': 1.4,
  'uncertainty_scale': 1.4,
  'factors': ['unseen / hidden hazard'],
  'explanation': 'Language-driven factors:\n  - unseen / hidden hazard'
}

Planner Parameters: {
  'max_linear_velocity': 0.43,
  'max_angular_velocity': 0.71,
  'obstacle_inflation_radius': 0.56,
  'goal_tolerance': 0.21,
  'lambda_risk': 0.75
}
```

**Interpretation**

- Metrics indicate high drift → the self-healing policy **triggers** and recommends:
  - adjusting the state estimator,
  - increasing the risk weight λ.
- The language message describes a *hidden danger* → both risk and uncertainty increase.

Combined effect:

- slower motion,
- larger safety margins,
- higher penalty on risk in the cost function.

This yields more conservative, robustness-oriented navigation.

### Step 4 – Greek Input, Slippery Corridor, Safe Mode

```text
===== STEP 4 =====
Message: Ο διάδρομος είναι γλιστερός και επικίνδυνος.

Self-Healing Decision: {
  'SELF_HEALING_TRIGGER': False,
  'reasons': [
    'heuristic_regret 0.90 ≥ threshold 0.60',
    'failure_rate 0.70 ≥ threshold 0.40'
  ],
  'recommended_actions': [
    'retrain_heuristic_small_batch',
    'review_recent_failures',
    'activate_safe_mode',
    'increase_monitoring_frequency',
    'increase_risk_weight'
  ],
  'new_lambda': 0.75,
  'safe_mode': True
}

Language Safety: {
  'risk_scale': 1.8,
  'uncertainty_scale': 1.5,
  'factors': ['slippery / wet floor'],
  'explanation': 'Language-driven factors:\n  - slippery / wet floor'
}

Planner Parameters: {
  'max_linear_velocity': 0.2,
  'max_angular_velocity': 0.5,
  'obstacle_inflation_radius': 0.72,
  'goal_tolerance': 0.225,
  'lambda_risk': 0.75
}
```

**Interpretation**

- High heuristic regret and failure rate → self-healing recommends:
  - retraining the heuristic,
  - reviewing recent failures,
  - **activating Safe Mode**,
  - increasing monitoring frequency,
  - increasing λ (risk weight).
- The Greek message indicates a *slippery and dangerous* corridor → risk and uncertainty increase further.

Combined effect:

- very low speed (`max_linear_velocity = 0.2 m/s`),
- increased obstacle inflation radius,
- Safe Mode engaged.

This is a plausible and desirable behavior in hazardous conditions, both technically and ethically.

## Are These Results “Real” or “Simulated”?

These results are produced by **real algorithms**, but currently run in a **software-only simulation**:

- no real robot hardware,
- no real sensors,
- no ROS topics.

Despite that, the logic is scientifically grounded:

- risk and uncertainty are modulated by language semantics,
- self-healing reacts to degradation in reliability metrics,
- planner parameters are adapted in a way that can be mapped directly to a real navigation stack.

This module represents the **algorithmic and integration layer**.  
The next step is to connect these policies to a real navigation system (e.g., ROS / Nav2 / `move_base`), so that the same decisions control an actual robot.
